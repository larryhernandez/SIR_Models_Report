# Description: Report on SIR Models
A report that I composed for a university level Mathematics course on "Stochastic Methods in Biology". This report is intended to provide an introduction to the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model which describes / computes the number of people infected with a contagious disease in a closed population over time. In this report the Deterministic (Ordinary Differential Equation) and Stochastic cases are reviewed and compared.

# Final Report
[The SIR Epidemic Model](https://github.com/larryhernandez/The_SIR_Epidemic_Model/blob/master/SIRModel_LHernandez.pdf) as PDF <br>

For those interested, the [LaTex](https://github.com/larryhernandez/The_SIR_Epidemic_Model/blob/master/SIRModels_LHernandez.tex) file used to create this report.
