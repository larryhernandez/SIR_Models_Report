# Description
This is a report that I wrote as a final project for a university level computational Mathematics course called "Stochastic Methods in Biology". This report is intended to provide a rudimentary introduction to the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model. The SIR model provides a mathematical description for the number of people infected with a contagious disease in a closed population over time. In this report the Deterministic (Ordinary Differential Equation) and Stochastic cases are reviewed and compared via simulation.

For those interested, the [LaTex](https://github.com/larryhernandez/The_SIR_Epidemic_Model/blob/master/SIRModels_LHernandez.tex) file used to create this report.
