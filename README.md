# SIR_Models_Report
A report that I authored for a university level Mathematics course on "Stochastic Methods in Biology". This report is intended to provide an introduction to the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model which describes / computes the number of people infected with a contagious disease in a closed population over time. In this report the Deterministic (Ordinary Differential Equation) and Stochastic cases are reviewed and compared.
